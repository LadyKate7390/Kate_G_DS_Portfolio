# Portfolio of Katherine Grey 
Portfolio of Data Science: Mostly for use with my Capstone course.  This porfolio will spotlight 12 projects of varying subject matter.  I have tried to pick projects that speak to me and my intersts. 
# Projects 12 total Projects
## [Predictive Failure:](https://github.com/LadyKate7390/Kate_G_DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Predictive_Failure)
  This project takes a data set of 3 different types of mill machines and creates a model to predict failure based on several features of the data. 
## Sonic Wave Velcoity Prediction
  Sonic waves both compresional and shearwave modalities are used for various applications.  In this project these waves are used in Geophysics for determing the underlying structures of the ground based out fuorier transfer technique. 
## Customer Loyalty Prediction
  This data science project will look at shopping habits or a customer data set to determine what drives the customers in this dataset to be loyal or not. 
## Mental Disorder Classifier 
  This data set contains demogrpahic information, age, sex, if the have a diganosis, if they recieve therapy etc.  It will build a classification model to then sort a new data into the appropriate classification.
## Customer Personality Analysis
  This project will look at advertising response information to then analysis what types a media is more effective for a given customer profile.  
## Heart Attack Prediction
  This project I will be branching into tools that did not exist when I first started down the data science road.  The Eval ML(auto ML) will be built to then create a modeling frame work to try and predict heart attack risk 
## Gas Price Forecasting
  An oldy put a goody as the say.  Using Sk Learn to try and predict future gas price based on current ( well at time of the data creation) information. 
## Employee Evaluation for Promotion
  A simple project to evaluate the worth of an employee based on performance metrics and then recommend the candidate(s) thats meet the selected critiera.  This is interesting because there are many possible instance to put bias into this model, good ethical coding is crucial to not poison the model
## Social Anxiety 
  Some basic data evaluation wiht visuals and some simple data manipulation.  Thinking of adding a regression model to see if there are correlations between certian features and anxiety. 
# How this should work 
  ## Hopes for the future
  This portfolio will be set up with sub folders for each of the projects that will house either the raw code or a Jupyter Notebook of the project. Also in each sub folder, or at least those used as the 3 for the capstone course will have a slide Deck and audio file of the presentation.  The idea being to give a complete picture of not just my abilities to build a project but to also compose and present the findings.  Each Project title in this readMe will eventualy be hyperlinked to the project folders.  All of this will be hosted here on Git.
